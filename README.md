Drishti 👓
Smart Assistive System for Visually Impaired Users in Sri Lanka
📌 Project Overview

Drishti is a smart assistive solution designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings independently.
The system combines a mobile application and smart spectacles to provide real-time assistance using audio feedback.

The project focuses on localised accessibility, with features tailored specifically for Sri Lankan users.

🎯 Problem Statement

Visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka face challenges such as:

Difficulty detecting obstacles in unfamiliar environments
